# Hyva_AdminTest

A small module to visually test [Hyva_Admin](https://github.com/hyva-themes/magento2-hyva-admin).

A link to the test page can be found in the admin menu in
*System > Tools > Hyva Test*.

This module expects the Sample Data to be installed.

## Stability

The module is NOT considered production code. Anything can change at any time. It exists only to test and demonstrate Hyva_Admin features.

## Contributions

PR's are very welcome.
